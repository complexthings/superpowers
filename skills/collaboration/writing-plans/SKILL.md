name: writing-plans
description: Use when you have a spec or requirements for a multi-step task, before touching code. Trigger this whenever a user says "write a plan", "create an implementation plan", "plan this out", "spec this task", or is about to implement something with multiple moving parts. Also use proactively when brainstorming has just completed and the next step is implementation.

# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for the codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about the toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming skill).

**Save plans to:** `.agents/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`
- (User preferences for plan location override this default)

## Scope Check

If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, it should have been broken into sub-project specs during brainstorming. If it wasn't, suggest breaking this into separate plans — one per subsystem. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is responsible for. This is where decomposition decisions get locked in.

- Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility.
- You reason best about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones that do too much.
- Files that change together should live together. Split by responsibility, not by technical layer.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns. If a file you're modifying has grown unwieldy, including a split in the plan is reasonable.

This structure informs the task decomposition. Each task should produce self-contained changes that make sense independently.

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (if subagents available) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

```

## Task Structure

Each task follows the TDD pattern with exact file paths, complete code, and exact commands:

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**
  ```python
  def test_specific_behavior():
      result = function(input)
      assert result == expected
  ```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**
  Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
  Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**
  ```python
  def function(input):
      return expected
  ```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**
  Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
  Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**
  ```bash
  git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
  git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
  ```
````

Steps use `- [ ]` checkbox syntax so agents and humans can track progress.

## Plan Review Loop

After completing each chunk, dispatch the plan-document-reviewer subagent using the template in `plan-document-reviewer-prompt.md`. Fix any issues, re-review until approved. Chunk boundaries use `## Chunk N: <name>` headings (≤1000 lines each). Loop cap: 5 iterations before surfacing to human.

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, prompt: **"Plan complete and saved to `.agents/superpowers/specs/<filename>.md`. Ready to execute?"**

- **With subagents** → Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (required, not optional)
- **Without subagents** → Use `superpowers:executing-plans` in current session
