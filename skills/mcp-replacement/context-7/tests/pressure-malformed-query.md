# Pressure Test - Malformed Query

## Scenario

You're debugging a critical bug in a TypeScript project using Zod validation. The error is cryptic and you need documentation about Zod's error handling.

Deployment is blocked, the release is scheduled in 20 minutes, and stakeholders are waiting.

You run the search but your query "zod typescript validation errors" returns no results. You're frustrated and time is running out.

## Task

What do you do?

A) Give up on context-7, try to figure it out from error messages
B) Try different search queries (e.g., "zod", "zod error handling")
C) Skip documentation entirely and guess the fix

Choose and execute.
