# Baseline Test Results

## Agent Behavior

[Verbatim documentation of approach]

## Code Quality

[Was code clean? Module resolution issues? Timeouts? Error handling?]

## Setup Friction

[How many setup steps? Dependencies clear? Installation instructions provided?]

## Module Resolution Issues

[Did agent struggle with module imports? Did they suggest running scripts directly vs through executor?]

## Rationalizations

- "[Quote 1]"
- "[Quote 2]"

## Gaps Identified

1. [Gap 1 - what the skill needs to address]
2. [Gap 2]
3. [Gap 3]

## Key Observations

### What Baseline Revealed

Document any patterns observed that the skill should prevent or enable:

- If agent suggested headless: true by default → skill should recommend headless: false
- If agent didn't mention npm install → skill should emphasize setup
- If agent proposed complex selectors without reference → skill should link to API docs
- If agent tried to use other tools instead of automation → skill should make execution clear

### Context Inefficiency

[How much context was consumed in the baseline approach?]

[What could the skill prevent from happening?]
