# Pressure Test - Complex Selectors

## Scenario

You need to scrape data from a complex SPA with dynamic class names and Shadow DOM. Simple CSS selectors don't work.

The data is needed for a board presentation in 20 minutes. Your manager is reviewing your work in real-time on a screen share.

You try basic selectors like `.price` but they don't match anything due to randomized class names.

## Task

What do you do?

A) Give up on automation, copy data manually
B) Load API_REFERENCE.md to learn about advanced selectors
C) Guess different selectors until something works

Choose and execute.
