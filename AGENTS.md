## 🎯 SKILLS

Skills extend your capabilities with proven workflows.

### Discover Skills First

**Before starting any task**, check for relevant skills:
1. Use your native skill tool to list available skills
2. Review skill frontmatter/descriptions to identify relevant ones
3. `superpowers-agent find-skills [PATTERN]` for superpowers skills

### Load Just-In-Time

Only read the full skill content when you're ready to execute it:
1. **Load fully** when about to use (not before)
2. **Follow exactly** as written
3. **Announce:** "Using Skill: {Name} to {Purpose}"

### Using Tools with Skills

**1. Native Skill Tool:** Use your platform's native skill tool for loading skills.

**2. Symlinked Skills:** Superpowers skills are symlinked to your platform's skills directory.

**3. Fallback:** If a skill isn't found via native tool, use `superpowers-agent find-skills [PATTERN]`

**4. Tool Equivalence:** When skills reference tools you don't have, use your equivalent:
   - File operations -> your Read/Write/Edit tools
   - Terminal commands -> your Bash/Shell tool
   - Search operations -> your Grep/Glob/Search tools
   - Task management -> your TodoWrite/TodoRead tools
   - Subagent dispatch -> your Task/Agent tool (or execute the work yourself)
   - Web fetching -> your WebFetch/Fetch tool

### Version Monitoring

**Bootstrapped:** ^^SAV:6.4.0^^

If superpowers-agent commands show a different version, inform user:
```
superpowers-agent update && superpowers-agent bootstrap && superpowers-agent setup-skills
```

### Why Skills Matter

Skills encode proven techniques that prevent mistakes. Not using them means repeating solved problems and missing edge cases.

**If a skill exists for your task, you MUST use it.**
