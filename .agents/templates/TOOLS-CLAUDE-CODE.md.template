#### Tool Mapping for Claude Code

When skills reference tools you don't have, substitute your equivalent tools:
- `TodoWrite` → `TodoWrite` (create and manage task lists with status tracking)
- `TodoRead` → Check todo list via system reminders (automatically provided)
- `Task` → `Task` (dispatch specialized subagents: general-purpose, Explore, Plan, claude-code-guide, code-reviewer, or custom agents)
- `Skill` → `Skill` tool (native) or `superpowers-agent execute` command (both available)
- `SlashCommand` → Use `/command-name` syntax (execute custom slash commands from .claude/commands/)
- `Read` → `Read` tool (read files including images, PDFs, Jupyter notebooks; supports offset/limit for large files)
- `Write` → `Write` tool (create/overwrite files; requires prior Read for existing files)
- `Edit` → `Edit` tool (exact string replacements; supports replace_all for renaming)
- `Bash` → `Bash` tool (execute shell commands with timeout support; supports background execution)
- `List` → `Read` tool with directory path or `Bash` with `ls`/`tree` commands
- `Grep` → `Grep` tool (ripgrep-based search with regex, supports -A/-B/-C context, multiple output modes)
- `Glob` → `Glob` tool (find files by glob pattern, sorted by modification time)
- `WebFetch` → `WebFetch` tool (fetch and analyze web content with AI processing)
- `WebSearch` → `WebSearch` tool (search the web with domain filtering)
- `NotebookEdit` → `NotebookEdit` tool (edit/insert/delete Jupyter notebook cells)
- `BashOutput` → `BashOutput` tool (retrieve output from background shells)
- `KillShell` → `KillShell` tool (terminate background shells)
- `AskUserQuestion` → `AskUserQuestion` tool (ask questions with multiple choice options during execution)
- `ExitPlanMode` → `ExitPlanMode` tool (prompt user to exit plan mode and start coding)
- `GetDiagnostics` → `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` (get VS Code language diagnostics)
- `ExecuteCode` → `mcp__ide__executeCode` (execute code in Jupyter kernel)

##### Native Skill Tool

You have a `Skill` tool for loading skills. **Use it by default** for skills in your platform directories:
- Project: `.claude/skills/`
- Personal: `~/.claude/skills/`
- Enterprise: Managed settings (deployed by administrators)
- Plugin: Skills bundled with installed plugins

Skills are symlinked across platforms, so superpowers skills are accessible at `~/.claude/skills/superpowers/`.
