##### Native Skill Tool

You have a `Skill` tool for loading skills. **Use it by default** for skills in your platform directories:
- Project: `.github/skills/`
- Personal: `~/.copilot/skills/`

Skills are symlinked across platforms, so superpowers skills are accessible at `~/.copilot/skills/superpowers/`.
