**Tool Mapping for GitHub Copilot:**
When skills reference tools you don't have, substitute your equivalent tools:
- `TodoWrite` → `manage_todo_list` (create and manage task lists with status tracking: not-started, in-progress, completed)
- `TodoRead` → Check todo list via `manage_todo_list` with `read` operation (view current task states)
- `Task` tool with subagents → `runSubagent` (dispatch autonomous agents for complex multi-step tasks; agent returns single final message)
- `Skill` tool → `superpowers-agent execute` command (load and execute skills via CLI)
- `Read` → `read_file` (read file contents with optional offset/limit for large files; max 2000 lines per call)
- `Write` → `create_file` (create new files with content; automatically creates parent directories)
- `Edit` → `replace_string_in_file` or `multi_replace_string_in_file` (exact string replacements; include 3-5 lines context before/after)
- `Bash` → `run_in_terminal` (execute zsh commands; supports background processes with isBackground flag)
- `List` → `list_dir` (list directory contents; returns names with trailing / for folders)
- `Grep` → `grep_search` (search file contents with text or regex patterns; supports includePattern for file filtering)
- `Glob` → `file_search` (find files by glob pattern; returns matching file paths)
- `WebFetch` → `fetch_webpage` (fetch and extract main content from web pages for summarization)
- `CodebaseSearch` → `semantic_search` (natural language search for relevant code in workspace; fallback to `grep_search` for exact matches)
- `NotebookEdit` → `edit_notebook_file` (edit Jupyter notebooks: insert, edit, or delete cells by cellId)
- `ReadLints` → `get_errors` (retrieve compile/lint errors for specific files or entire workspace)
- `DeleteFile` → `run_in_terminal` with `rm` command (no dedicated delete tool; use shell command)
- `GetTerminalOutput` → `get_terminal_output` (retrieve output from background terminal processes)
- `Git` → `get_changed_files` (get git diffs of staged/unstaged changes; fallback to `run_in_terminal` for other git operations)
- `NotebookSummary` → `copilot_getNotebookSummary` (get cell metadata: ids, types, languages, execution info, outputs)
- `NotebookRun` → `run_notebook_cell` (execute code cells in Jupyter notebooks by cellId)
