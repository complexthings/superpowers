### Using Tools with Skills

**1. Native Skill Tool:** Use your platform's native skill tool for loading skills.

**2. Symlinked Skills:** Superpowers skills are symlinked to your platform's skills directory.

**3. Fallback:** If a skill isn't found via native tool, use `superpowers-agent find-skills [PATTERN]`

**4. Tool Equivalence:** When skills reference tools you don't have, use your equivalent:
   - File operations -> your Read/Write/Edit tools
   - Terminal commands -> your Bash/Shell tool
   - Search operations -> your Grep/Glob/Search tools
   - Task management -> your TodoWrite/TodoRead tools
   - Subagent dispatch -> your Task/Agent tool (or execute the work yourself)
   - Web fetching -> your WebFetch/Fetch tool
