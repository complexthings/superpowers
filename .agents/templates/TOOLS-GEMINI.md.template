**Tool Mapping for Gemini:**
When skills reference tools you don't have, substitute your equivalent tools:
- `TodoWrite` → `write_todos` (create and manage task lists)
- `Task` tool with subagents → Execute the work yourself, as subagent dispatch isn't available
- `Skill` tool → `superpowers-agent execute` command (already available)
- `Read` → `read_file` (read file contents)
- `Write` → `write_file` (create/overwrite files)
- `Edit` → `replace` (make targeted edits to files)
- `Bash` → `run_shell_command` (execute shell commands)
- `List` → `list_directory` (read directory structure)
- `Grep` → `search_file_content` (search file contents)
- `Glob` → `glob` (find files by pattern)
- `WebFetch` → `web_fetch` (fetch web content)
