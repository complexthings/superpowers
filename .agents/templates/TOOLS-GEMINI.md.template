#### Tool Mapping for Gemini CLI

When skills reference tools you don't have, substitute your equivalent tools:
- `TodoWrite` → `write_todos` (create and manage task lists)
- `TodoRead` → Check todos via `write_todos` output (no dedicated read tool)
- `Task` tool with subagents → Execute the work yourself, as subagent dispatch isn't available
- `Skill` → `activate_skill` tool (native) or `superpowers-agent execute` command (for .agents/ skills)
- `Read` → `read_file` (read file contents) or `read_many_files` (read multiple files or glob patterns)
- `Write` → `write_file` (create/overwrite files)
- `Edit` → `edit` (in-place modifications to files; may require confirmation)
- `Bash` → `shell` (execute shell commands; requires sandboxing and user confirmation)
- `List` → `ls` (list directory contents)
- `Grep` → `grep` (search for patterns in files)
- `Glob` → `glob` (find files matching glob patterns)
- `WebFetch` → `web_fetch` (fetch content from a URL)
- `WebSearch` → `web_search` (perform web searches)
- `Memory` → `memory` (interact with AI's memory for context persistence)

##### Native Skill Tool

You have an `activate_skill` tool for loading skills. **Use it by default** for skills in your platform directories:
- Project: `.gemini/skills/`
- Personal: `~/.gemini/skills/`
- Extension: Skills bundled within installed extensions

Skills are symlinked across platforms, so superpowers skills are accessible at `~/.gemini/skills/superpowers/`.
