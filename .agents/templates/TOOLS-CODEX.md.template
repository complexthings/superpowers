#### Tool Mapping for Codex

When skills reference tools you don't have, substitute your equivalent tools:
- `TodoWrite` → `update_plan` (simple step tracker; no full todo manager)
- `TodoRead` → Check plan via `update_plan` output (no dedicated read tool)
- `Task` tool with subagents → Execute the work yourself (no subagent tool)
- `Skill` → `$skill-name` prefix (native) or `superpowers-agent execute` command (for .agents/ skills)
- `Read` → `shell_command` with `cat`/`head`/`tail` (no dedicated read tool)
- `Write` → `apply_patch` (create/edit files) or `shell_command` with redirection for new files
- `Edit` → `apply_patch` (targeted edits using unified diff format)
- `Bash` → `shell_command` (execute shell commands)
- `List` → `shell_command` with `ls` or `find` commands
- `Grep` → `shell_command` with `rg` (ripgrep) or `grep` commands
- `Glob` → `shell_command` with `rg --files` or `find` commands
- `WebFetch` → `web_search_request` (fetch web content and search results)

##### Native Skill Tool

Codex has native skill support using the `$skill-name` prefix or `/skills` slash command. **Use it by default** for skills in your platform directories:
- Project: `.codex/skills/` (current working directory)
- Personal: `~/.codex/skills/` (user home directory)
- System: `/etc/codex/skills/` (admin-deployed skills)

Skills are symlinked across platforms, so superpowers skills are accessible at `~/.codex/skills/superpowers/`.
