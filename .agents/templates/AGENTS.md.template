## 🎯 SKILLS

Skills extend your capabilities with proven workflows. You discover skills via metadata, then load instructions **just-in-time** before use.

**Key principle:** Don't read skill files upfront. Load them only when you're about to execute them.

### Installation Check

If `superpowers-agent` is not available, install it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/complexthings/superpowers/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Updates Monitoring

**Bootstrapped Version**: ^^SAV:{{VERSION}}^^

Your superpowers-agent may have updates available. If you see a different version
in command output (e.g., `^^SAV:5.5.0^^`) than shown above, run:

```bash
superpowers-agent update && superpowers-agent bootstrap && superpowers-agent setup-skills
```

This will update your Superpowers installation and refresh your project configuration.

**How Agents Should Use This Information:**

When you (the agent) start a conversation or run superpowers-agent commands:

1. **Note the bootstrapped version** shown above (`^^SAV:{{VERSION}}^^`)
2. **Check command output** - Most `superpowers-agent` commands display `^^SAV:X.Y.Z^^` at the start
3. **Compare versions** - If the command version differs from bootstrapped version:
   
   Inform the user: "Your superpowers-agent may have updates available, run 
   `superpowers-agent update && superpowers-agent bootstrap && superpowers-agent setup-skills` 
   to update your Superpowers and Project!"

4. **When to check**:
   - At the start of new conversations
   - When commands behave unexpectedly  
   - When user asks about updates or capabilities

**Version Detection Examples:**

```
# Outdated - needs update
Bootstrapped: ^^SAV:5.4.0^^
Command output: ^^SAV:5.5.0^^
→ Notify user to update

# Up to date
Bootstrapped: ^^SAV:5.4.0^^
Command output: ^^SAV:5.4.0^^
→ No action needed
```

### HOW TO USE SKILLS

<CRITICAL>
**Load skills just-in-time — only when you're about to use them, not upfront.**
</CRITICAL>

#### Step 1: Discover Skills

| If you have... | Then... |
|----------------|---------|
| Native skill tool (see table below) | Skills in your platform directories are auto-discovered |
| No native tool OR need superpowers skills | Run `superpowers-agent find-skills [PATTERN]` |

#### Step 2: Load & Execute

| Skill Location | How to Load |
|----------------|-------------|
| Your platform's directory (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, etc.) | Use your native skill tool |
| `.agents/skills/` or `superpowers:` prefixed | Use `superpowers-agent execute {name}` then Read |
| Native tool fails or skill not found | Fall back to `superpowers-agent execute` |

#### Native Skill Tools

| Agent | Native Tool | Skill Locations |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| GitHub Copilot | `Skill` tool | `.github/skills/`, `~/.copilot/skills/` |
| Claude Code | `Skill` tool | `.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/` |
| OpenCode | `skill` tool | `.opencode/skill/`, `~/.config/opencode/skill/` |
| Cursor | Automatic discovery | `.cursor/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/` |
| Gemini | `activate_skill` tool | `.gemini/skills/`, `~/.gemini/skills/` |
| Codex | $skill-name | `.codex/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/` |

#### JIT Rules

- Load skills only when you're about to use them, not before
- If given a sequence of skills, load each one immediately before that step
- If you already loaded a skill earlier in this session and it's in context, don't re-load

#### When to Look for Skills

- Before starting any task
- When unsure how to approach something
- When the task matches a skill description you've seen

### WHY THIS MATTERS

Skills document **proven techniques** that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means:

- ❌ Repeating already-solved problems
- ❌ Making known errors
- ❌ Skipping critical workflows (TDD, debugging, verification)
- ❌ Wasting context by loading skills you won't use

**If a skill exists for your task, you MUST use it.**

### COMMON MISTAKES

Reject these rationalizations:

- ❌ "I'll read all the skills upfront to understand them" → Load JIT only
- ❌ "This is too simple for a skill" → Simple tasks benefit most from proven process
- ❌ "I already know how to do this" → Skills encode edge cases you'll miss
- ❌ "I'll just skim the skill" → Follow instructions exactly as written

### REFERENCE

**Tool Mappings:**

{{TOOL_MAPPINGS}}

#### Skill Locations

- Project: `.agents/skills/` > `.claude/skills/` > `.copilot/skills/` > `.opencode/skill/` > `.cursor/skills/` > `.gemini/skills/` > `.codex/skills/`
- Personal: `~/.agents/skills/` > `~/.claude/skills/` > `~/.copilot/skills/` > `~/.config/opencode/skill/` > `~/.cursor/skills/` > `~/.gemini/skills/` > `~/.codex/skills/`
- Superpowers: `~/.agents/superpowers/skills/`

Priority: Project > Personal > Superpowers (when names match)

#### Skill Naming

- Project skills: `skill-name`
- Claude skills: `claude:skill-name`
- Copilot skills: `copilot:skill-name`
- OpenCode skills: `opencode:skill-name`
- Cursor skills: `cursor:skill-name`
- Gemini skills: `gemini:skill-name`
- Codex skills: `codex:skill-name`
- Personal skills: `skill-name`
- Superpowers skills: `superpowers:skill-name`

#### Skills with Checklists

If a skill has a checklist, create todos for EACH item. Mental tracking = steps get skipped.

#### Creating New Skills

Use the `writing-skills` skill. Brainstorm first with `brainstorming`, then test with `testing-skills-with-subagents`.

<IMPORTANT>
**IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU MUST USE IT.**

Announce when using a skill: "Using Skill: {Name} to {Purpose}"
</IMPORTANT>
