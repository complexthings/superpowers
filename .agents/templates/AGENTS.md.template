## 🎯 SKILLS

Skills extend your capabilities with proven workflows. You discover skills via metadata, then load instructions **just-in-time** before use.

**Key principle:** Don't read skill files upfront. Load them only when you're about to execute them.

### Installation Check

If `superpowers-agent` is not available, install it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/complexthings/superpowers/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Updates Monitoring

**Bootstrapped Version**: ^^SAV:{{VERSION}}^^

Your superpowers-agent may have updates available. If you see a different version
in command output (e.g., `^^SAV:5.5.0^^`) than shown above, run:

```bash
superpowers-agent update && superpowers-agent bootstrap && superpowers-agent setup-skills
```

This will update your Superpowers installation and refresh your project configuration.

**How Agents Should Use This Information:**

When you (the agent) start a conversation or run superpowers-agent commands:

1. **Note the bootstrapped version** shown above (`^^SAV:{{VERSION}}^^`)
2. **Check command output** - Most `superpowers-agent` commands display `^^SAV:X.Y.Z^^` at the start
3. **Compare versions** - If the command version differs from bootstrapped version:
   
   Inform the user: "Your superpowers-agent may have updates available, run 
   `superpowers-agent update && superpowers-agent bootstrap && superpowers-agent setup-skills` 
   to update your Superpowers and Project!"

4. **When to check**:
   - At the start of new conversations
   - When commands behave unexpectedly  
   - When user asks about updates or capabilities

**Version Detection Examples:**

```
# Outdated - needs update
Bootstrapped: ^^SAV:5.4.0^^
Command output: ^^SAV:5.5.0^^
→ Notify user to update

# Up to date
Bootstrapped: ^^SAV:5.4.0^^
Command output: ^^SAV:5.4.0^^
→ No action needed
```

### REQUIRED WORKFLOW

<CRITICAL>
**Do not read skill files upfront. Load them just-in-time when you're about to use them.**
</CRITICAL>

**Discover available skills:**
```bash
superpowers-agent find-skills [PATTERN]
```
This shows skill names and descriptions. Use descriptions to decide which skill applies.

**When ready to use a skill:**
```bash
superpowers-agent execute {Skill Name}
```
This shows the skill path and tells you to read it. Use your `Read` tool (or `cat` if `Read` doesn't work for external paths), then follow the instructions exactly.

---

**JIT Rules:**
- Only run `execute` + `Read` when you're about to use a skill, not before
- If given a sequence of skills, load each one immediately before that step
- If you already read a skill earlier in this session and it's in context, don't re-read

**When to look for skills:**
- Before starting any non-trivial task
- When unsure how to approach something
- When the task matches a skill description you saw in `find-skills`

### WHY THIS MATTERS

Skills document **proven techniques** that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means:

- ❌ Repeating already-solved problems
- ❌ Making known errors
- ❌ Skipping critical workflows (TDD, debugging, verification)
- ❌ Wasting context by loading skills you won't use

**If a skill exists for your task, you MUST use it.**

### COMMON MISTAKES

Reject these rationalizations:

- ❌ "I'll read all the skills upfront to understand them" → Load JIT only
- ❌ "This is too simple for a skill" → Simple tasks benefit most from proven process
- ❌ "I already know how to do this" → Skills encode edge cases you'll miss
- ❌ "I'll just skim the skill" → Follow instructions exactly as written

### REFERENCE

**Tool Mappings:**

{{TOOL_MAPPINGS}}

**Skill Locations:**
- Project: `.agents/skills/` > `.claude/skills/` > `.copilot/skills/` > `.opencode/skills/` > `.gemini/skills/`
- Personal: `~/.agents/skills/` > `~/.claude/skills/` > `~/.copilot/skills/` > `~/.opencode/skills/` > `~/.gemini/skills/`
- Superpowers: `~/.agents/superpowers/skills/`

Priority: Project > Personal > Superpowers (when names match)

**Skill Naming:**
- Project skills: `skill-name`
- Claude skills: `claude:skill-name`
- Copilot skills: `copilot:skill-name`
- OpenCode skills: `opencode:skill-name`
- Gemini skills: `gemini:skill-name`
- Personal skills: `skill-name`
- Superpowers skills: `superpowers:skill-name`

**Skills with Checklists:**
If a skill has a checklist, create todos for EACH item. Mental tracking = steps get skipped.

**Creating New Skills:**
Use the `writing-skills` skill. Brainstorm first with `brainstorming`, then test with `testing-skills-with-subagents`.

---

<IMPORTANT>
**IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU MUST USE IT.**

Announce when using a skill: "Using Skill: {Name} to {Purpose}"
</IMPORTANT>
