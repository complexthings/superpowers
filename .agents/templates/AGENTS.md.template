## 🎯 SKILLS

Skills extend your capabilities with proven workflows.

### Discover Skills First

**Before starting any task**, check for relevant skills:
1. Use your native skill tool to list available skills
2. Review skill frontmatter/descriptions to identify relevant ones
3. `superpowers-agent find-skills [PATTERN]` for superpowers skills

### Load Just-In-Time

Only read the full skill content when you're ready to execute it:
1. **Load fully** when about to use (not before)
2. **Follow exactly** as written
3. **Announce:** "Using Skill: {Name} to {Purpose}"

### Version Monitoring

**Bootstrapped:** ^^SAV:{{VERSION}}^^

If superpowers-agent commands show a different version, inform user:
```
superpowers-agent update && superpowers-agent bootstrap && superpowers-agent setup-skills
```

### Why Skills Matter

Skills encode proven techniques that prevent mistakes. Not using them means repeating solved problems and missing edge cases.

**If a skill exists for your task, you MUST use it.**
