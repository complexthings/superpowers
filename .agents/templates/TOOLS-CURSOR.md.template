**Tool Mapping for Cursor:**
When skills reference tools you don't have, substitute your equivalent tools:
- `TodoWrite` → `todo_write` (manage task lists with status tracking: pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- `TodoRead` → Check todo list via system context (automatically tracked)
- `Task` tool with subagents → Execute the work yourself, as subagent dispatch isn't available
- `Skill` tool → `superpowers-agent execute` command (already available)
- `Read` → `read_file` (read file contents with optional offset/limit for large files; supports images)
- `Write` → `write` (create/overwrite files; requires prior read_file for existing files)
- `Edit` → `search_replace` (exact string replacements; supports replace_all for renaming across file)
- `Bash` → `run_terminal_cmd` (execute terminal commands; supports background execution and permission requests)
- `List` → `list_dir` (list directory contents with optional ignore globs)
- `Grep` → `grep` (ripgrep-based search with regex, supports -A/-B/-C context, multiple output modes)
- `Glob` → `glob_file_search` (find files by glob pattern, sorted by modification time)
- `CodebaseSearch` → `codebase_search` (semantic search to find code by meaning, not exact text)
- `WebFetch` → `web_search` (search the web for real-time information)
- `NotebookEdit` → `edit_notebook` (edit Jupyter notebook cells: create, edit, or clear cell content)
- `ReadLints` → `read_lints` (read linter/diagnostic errors from workspace files)
- `DeleteFile` → `delete_file` (delete files at specified path)
- MCP Tools → Various MCP server tools available (Playwright browser automation, Context7 docs, etc.)
