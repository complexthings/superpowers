#### Tool Mapping for OpenCode

When skills reference tools you don't have, substitute your equivalent tools:
- `TodoWrite` → `todowrite` (manage todo lists with status tracking: pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- `TodoRead` → `todoread` (read current todo list state)
- `Task` → `task` (dispatch specialized subagents: general, explore, or custom agents for complex multi-step tasks)
- `Skill` → `skill` tool (native) or `superpowers-agent execute` command (for .agents/ skills)
- `Read` → `read` (read file contents with line numbers; supports offset/limit for large files)
- `Write` → `write` (create new files or overwrite existing ones)
- `Edit` → `edit` (modify existing files using exact string replacements)
- `Patch` → `patch` (apply patches/diffs to files)
- `Bash` → `bash` (execute shell commands in project environment)
- `List` → `list` (list files and directories; accepts glob patterns to filter)
- `Grep` → `grep` (search file contents using regex; supports file pattern filtering)
- `Glob` → `glob` (find files by glob pattern like `**/*.js`; sorted by modification time)
- `WebFetch` → `webfetch` (fetch web content in text, markdown, or html format)
- `AskUserQuestion` → `question` (ask user questions during execution with multiple choice options)
- `LSP` → `lsp` (experimental: goToDefinition, findReferences, hover, documentSymbol, workspaceSymbol, goToImplementation, prepareCallHierarchy, incomingCalls, outgoingCalls)

##### Native Skill Tool

You have a `skill` tool for loading skills. **Use it by default** for skills in your platform directories:
- Project: `.opencode/skill/`
- Personal: `~/.config/opencode/skill/`
- Claude-compatible: `.claude/skills/` and `~/.claude/skills/`

Skills are symlinked across platforms, so superpowers skills are accessible at `~/.config/opencode/skill/superpowers/`.
