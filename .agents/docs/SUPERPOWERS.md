## Version Detection Details

When superpowers-agent runs, it displays its version as `^^SAV:X.Y.Z^^` in output.

**How to check for updates:**
1. Note the bootstrapped version in AGENTS.md: `^^SAV:6.4.0^^`
2. Compare with version shown when running superpowers-agent commands
3. If versions differ, inform user:
   ```
   Your superpowers-agent may have updates. Run:
   superpowers-agent update && superpowers-agent bootstrap && superpowers-agent setup-skills
   ```

**When to check:**
- At conversation start
- When commands behave unexpectedly
- When user asks about updates or capabilities

## Creating New Skills

1. Use the `brainstorming` skill to plan the skill
2. Use the `writing-skills` skill to create it
3. Test with `testing-skills-with-subagents`
4. Save to `.agents/skills/` (project) or `~/.agents/superpowers/skills/` (global)

---

## Skills with Checklists

If a skill has a checklist, create todos for EACH item. Mental tracking = steps get skipped.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Reject these rationalizations:

- "I'll read all the skills upfront to understand them" -> Load JIT only
- "This is too simple for a skill" -> Simple tasks benefit most from proven process
- "I already know how to do this" -> Skills encode edge cases you'll miss
- "I'll just skim the skill" -> Follow instructions exactly as written
