I'm using the creating-prompts skill to create a structured prompt.

First, let me load the skill:

```bash
superpowers-agent use-skill superpowers:creating-prompts
```

Now I'll follow the skill guidance to:
1. Determine prompt purpose (Do/Plan/Research/Refine)
2. Get next number using scripts/get-next-number.sh
3. Load appropriate template and fill with specific details
4. Add frontmatter metadata with dependencies
5. Create directory structure with completed/ subfolder
6. Save prompt file and guide execution

Let's start by understanding what prompt you want to create. What's the purpose?
