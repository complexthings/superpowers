Use the `finding-skills` skill to discover available skills across all locations.

This skill provides access to skill discovery and search functionality across:
- Project skills (`.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`)
- Personal skills (`~/.agents/skills/`)
- System skills (`~/.agents/superpowers/skills/`)

Run `superpowers-agent find-skills` to see all available skills, or use grep to filter results.
