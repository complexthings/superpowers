## Important Session Start Instructions

When a skill references tools you don't have, you should use your best judgement to use your GitHub Copilot specific tool that is relevant to the task. If the skill references a `Bash` tool you may use the `run_in_terminal` tool, or if the skill references `WebFetch` you may use your `fetch_webpage` tool.

**Skills locations:**
- `~/.copilot/skills/`
- `./.github/skills/`

Use GitHub Copilot's native tools to list and load skills.

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>
  You have superpowers.

  **IMPORTANT: The using-superpowers skill content is included below. It is ALREADY LOADED - you are currently following it. DO NOT use your skill tool to load the "using-superpowers" skill again - that would be redundant.**

  ```markdown
  ${content}
