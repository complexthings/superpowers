I'm using the brainstorming skill to help develop your idea.

First, let me load the skill:

```bash
~/.agents/superpowers/.agents/superpowers-agent use-skill superpowers:brainstorming
```

Now I'll follow the skill guidance to:
1. Understand current project context (files, docs, recent commits)
2. Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
3. Explore 2-3 alternative approaches with trade-offs
4. Present design in sections (200-300 words each) for validation
5. Write validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`

Let's start by understanding what you want to build. What's your idea?
